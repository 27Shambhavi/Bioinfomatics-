# Bioinfomatics
ðŸ§¬ Bioinformatics Drug Discovery Pipeline using ChEMBL
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a basic bioinformatics pipeline to search for potential drug candidates targeting coronavirus proteins using the ChEMBL Web Resource Client. The steps include:

Library Installation & Import

Installs and imports required packages like pandas and chembl_webresource_client.

Target Protein Search

Queries ChEMBL for target proteins related to coronavirus.

Retrieving Bioactivity Data

Fetches bioactivity data for selected target proteins, focusing on compounds tested for activity.

Filtering Active Compounds

Filters compounds based on bioactivity (e.g., IC50 values) to identify potentially effective drug candidates.

Data Analysis & Visualization

Analyzes and visualizes chemical properties of the compounds using pandas and matplotlib.

Final Dataset Preparation

Outputs a cleaned dataset of active compounds suitable for further research or machine learning.
